        <p>
          Welcome to Battleships, where strategic prowess and naval mastery collide! In this thrilling naval combat
          game, you command a fleet of powerful battleships, cruisers, and submarines, engaging in intense maritime
          warfare against your opponents. Plot your moves wisely on the expansive grid, deploy your vessels
          strategically, and unleash devastating salvos upon your foes. Customize your fleet, adapt to changing tides,
          and outmanoeuvre your adversaries to claim victory on the high seas. Whether you're a seasoned admiral or a
          novice tactician, Battleships offers an immersive and strategic gaming experience. May the wind be in your
          sails and your torpedoes find their mark!
          <br /><br />
          The first watery grid is your own. Click on it to place your ships at the start of the game. (Hold shift to
          change direction). <br />
          The second grid is that of your enemy. Once all the ships are placed, launch attacks by clicking on one of
          your opponent's grid cells. <br /><br />
